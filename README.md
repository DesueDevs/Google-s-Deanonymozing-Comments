# Google's Deanonymizing Comments

When attempting to share access to a Google Doc, sheet, or slide, you are presented with 2 methods. You can choose to either directly share access to the element or you can change the "general access" rule. The general access rule can be used to dictate if people can access the element using just a sharing link or not.

# Anonymous Mode

I've coined the Anonymous mode. When a user accesses a Google element through the general access sharing link, I've named it anonymous mode because when you access the element through the link instead of everyone seeing your personal Google account's name (like direct sharing does), you are given a username like "Anonymous Panda" or some variation of the animal. This anonymous mode username is used for almost all forms of interacting with the element, viewing, editing, and version history (though this doesn't show specific usernames and calls it "all anonymous users"). The discrepancy comes when commenting or using the suggestion feature.

# Deanonymizing Comments/Suggestions

When leaving a comment/suggestion while in anonymous mode and not signed into a Google account (you can tell you're not signed in by there being a blue sign-in button in the top right), your comment's author is listed as "Anonymous" as you would expect. The issue comes up when you're signed into your Google account because if you're signed in and you're in anonymous mode when commenting, the author of the comment would be listed as your Google account.

# Security Concern

In a perfect world, this is just a weird bug or inconsistency; sadly, this is the internet, and we can't have bugs without someone trying to exploit them. The security issues that this could cause would be opening up a point to gain information for targeted phishing attacks. Since the general access link allows anyone to access the Google doc without the owner knowing each person's specific email, it serves as a way an attacker could potentially collect employee emails. Something like a "Mark you were here by leaving a comment." could allow a simple way for attackers to find potential targets that arent very knowledgable about cybersecurity (to the level that they will search up random links) that an attacker could than send malware or a phishing site to the target.
