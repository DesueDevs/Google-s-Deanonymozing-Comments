# Google's Deanonymizing Comments
When attempting to share access to a google doc, sheet, or slide you are presented with 2 methods of sharing access. You can choose to either directly share access to the element{CHANGE WORD} or you can change the "general access" rule. The general access rule can be used to dictate if people can access the element using just a sharing link or not.

# Anonymous Mode
Anonymous mode is what ive coined it when a user accesses a google element through the general access sharing link, Ive named it anonymous mode because when you access the element through the link instead of everyone seeing your personal google account's name (like direct sharing does) you are given a username like "Anonymous panda" or some variation of the animal. This anonymous mode username is used for almost all forms of interacting with the element, viewing, editing, and version history (though this doesnt show specific usernames and calls it "all anonymous users"). The discrepency comes when commenting or using the suggestion feature.

# Deanonymizing Comments/Suggestions
When leaving a comment/suggestion while in anonymous mode and not signed into a google account (you can tell your not signed in by there being a blue sign-in button in the top right), your comment's author is listed as "Anonymous" as you would expect. The issue comes up when your signed into your google account, because if your signed-in and your in anonymous mode when commenting the author of the comment would be listed as your own personal google account.

# Security Concern
In a perfect world this is just a weird bug or inconsistantiancy, sadly this is the internet and we cant have bugs without someone trying to exploit them.
